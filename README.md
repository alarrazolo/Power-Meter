# Power-Meter

This repository is the source code for a real time power meter. 
It uses a Atmega 328p as its processor and interfaces with CT meters via a specialized power meter ADC front end.
It displays instantaneous and accumulated power readings out to an LCD and will eventually upload data up to web.
